## Assigning API query components

Thisstudy site and associated information was found using the USGS National Water Dashboard. The parameter codes were pulled from https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/parameter_cd?group_cd=%25

```{r}
## Maumelle River near Wye, AR - flows through Oklahoma and drains to Mississippi
## Water data back to 1989, supposedly
siteNumber <- c("07263296")

## temp, discharge, turbidity, dissolved o2, suspended sediment conc. respecitvely
parameterCd <- c("00010", "00060", "63680", "00300", "99409")

startDate <- "1989-01-01"
endDate <- "2021-10-01"
```

```{r}
water <- readNWISdv(siteNumber, parameterCd, startDate, endDate) %>% 
  rename(water_temp_c = X_00010_00003, discharge_cfs = X_00060_00003, turbidity_fnu = X_63680_00003, diss_02_mgl = X_00300_00003)
