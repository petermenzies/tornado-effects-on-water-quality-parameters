### Project Information:

This project aims to investigate effects that tornadoes have on various measures of water quality. The investigation will look at tornadoes and corresponding stream sites within the continental United States, primarily in the Midwest. 

### Data:

Our investigation will utilize water quality readings from USGS and tornado data from NOAA's Storm Prediction Center database. USGS water quality data has been retrieved using the `dataRetrieval` package. Tornado data was downloaded from NOAA's website at https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/#data.
